[Front Matter CMS](https://frontmatter.codes/) brings the CMS to your editor, it runs within Visual Studio Code, GitPod, and many more.

## Integration with Astro

In this section, we'll walk through how to add Front Matter CMS to your Astro project.

### Prerequisites 

- Visual Studio Code
- Project with content, a great start is the [Astro Blog template](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples/blog)

### Install the Front Matter CMS extension

You can get the extension from the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace - Front Matter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eliostruyf.vscode-front-matter) or by clicking on the following link: [open Front Matter CMS extension in VS Code](vscode:extension/eliostruyf.vscode-front-matter)

### Project initialization

Once Front Matter CMS is installed, you will get a new icon in the Activity Bar on the left side (or right side depending on your preference) of the editor. Click on it to open the **Front Matter CMS** panel.

- Click on the **Initialize project** button;
- The welcome screen will open and you can start initializing the project;
- Click on the first step to **Initialize project**;
- As Astro is one of the supported frameworks, you can select it from the list;
- Register your content folders, in this case, the `src/content/blog` folder;
- Click on **Show the dashboard** to open the content dashboard.

### Project configuration

Once the project is initialized, you will get a `frontmatter.json` configuration file and a `.frontmatter` folder in the root of your project.

<FileTree title="Project Structure">
- .frontmatter/
  - database/
    - mediaDb.json
- src/
- astro.config.mjs
- **frontmatter.json**
- package.json
</FileTree>

#### Content-type configuration

Content-types is the way Front Matter CMS knows how to handle your content. You can configure the content-types in the `frontmatter.json` file. 

- Open the `frontmatter.json` file;
- Replace the `frontMatter.taxonomy.contentTypes` array with the following content-types configuration:

```json title="frontmatter.json"
{
  "frontMatter.taxonomy.contentTypes": [
    {
      "name": "default",
      "pageBundle": false,
      "previewPath": "'blog'",
      "filePrefix": null,
      "fields": [
        {
          "title": "Title",
          "name": "title",
          "type": "string",
          "single": true
        },
        {
          "title": "Description",
          "name": "description",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "title": "Publishing date",
          "name": "pubDate",
          "type": "datetime",
          "default": "{{now}}",
          "isPublishDate": true
        },
        {
          "title": "Content preview",
          "name": "heroImage",
          "type": "image",
          "isPreviewImage": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

:::note
This configuration makes sure that the content-type matches the blog content in its fields.
